# ðŸ’» Flow Control Challenge 

A challenge where you must consider all prevoius lessons: synthax and conventions, conditionals, loops, exception handling etc. And apply what you consider useful to the following problem:

```
 Create a system that receives two parameters, each one a integer number, based on this numbers you'll define the number of iterations of a for loop to print on console the increased values.
```

 - If you pass numbers 12 and 30, then for will run 18 iterations to print numbers.
 - If the first parameter is greater than the second, you shall throw a custom exception *InvalidParametersException* that displays this message "Second parameter must be greater than first".

    1. Create a project *FlowControlChallenge*
    2. Inside it, create a class called *Counter.java*, that will contain the project main functionalities.
    3. In another class called *InvalidParametersException*, that represents our bussiness rules exceptions, develop a custom exception.
